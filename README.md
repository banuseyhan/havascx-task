# TASK
Description
What we expect to see for this assignment is a reusable table component written in React. A
reusable table component should be able to display a collection of structured data. This
component should be able to render any kind of JSX according to the column (a column can
be rendered as a button instead of text). Meetings can be arranged with the team to discuss
details about the assignment.
Base Requirements
1) The component must have to implement pagination logic to have stable performance
when used with large amounts of data
2) Table cells should be able to render any JSX content using render props
3) Table should be sortable on column header click (only 1 active sort)
4) Table should be flexible in width and height according to its parent
5) Use Typescript
Bonus Requirements
1) Table should be searchable by specified columns in props (search input can be above the
table)
2) Table should be filterable using distinct column values by specific columns
3) The user should be able to select one or more rows and process selected rows using
onSelectedChange prop
4) The user should be able to hide columns using a button in column headers
5) Unit tests for the component
6) Good graphical design and user experience of the component
